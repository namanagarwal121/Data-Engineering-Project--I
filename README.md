# Data-Engineering-Project--I

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to perform data analytics on Uber data using various tools and technologies, Jupyter lab, Python, Compute Instance, Mage Data Pipeline Tool, Mysql, and Power BI.



## Technology Used
- Programming Language - Python
- MSSQL
- Mage Ai
- Power Bi


Modern Data Pipeine Tool - https://www.mage.ai/


## Dataset Used
TLC Trip Record Data
Yellow and green taxi trip records include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts. 

Here is the dataset used in the video - https://github.com/darshilparmar/uber-etl-pipeline-data-engineering-project/blob/main/data/uber_data.csv

2. Data Dictionary - https://www.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/pdf/data_dictionary_trip_records_yellow.pdf

## Process
1. Storing Data in local drive
2. Loading Data to Mage ai 
    - Data Extraction
    - Data Transforamtion
    - Data Loading
    - Adding Triggers
3. Storing data in MSSQL
4. Data Visualisiation in Power Bi
